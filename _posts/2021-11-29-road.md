### Overview

[Road](https://tryhackme.com/room/road) is a medium rated CTF room on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) created by [StillNoob](https://tryhackme.com/p/StillNoob). Although rated as medium I would put it down as easy as the \*cough\* road is nicely laid out for you.

### Nmap

I started a nmap scan to check for available ports.

```highlight
└──╼ $sudo nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/initial 10.10.149.149
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-11-29 09:52 GMT

```

2 ports open:

- 22 - SSH - Openssh 8.2p1
- 80 - HTTP - Apache httpd 2.4.41

I did a second nmap scan on all ports but no other ports were open.

### Enumeration

Taking a look at the web server shows a simple courier web page. 

![homepage](/assets/images/road/homepage.png)

I tested the track order search but it didn't do anything so I moved on and clicked merchant central which took me to a login form. 

![login](/assets/images/road/login.png)

I tried a few common credentials combinations but had no joy so registered my own account.

![createuser](/assets/images/road/createuser.png)

Once in I got access to a static dashboard, none of the links on the left worked other than 'ResetUser'. However I could view my profile.

![dashboard](/assets/images/road/dashboard.png)

The only option available was to upload an image, however this needs be done my the admin. But now I have the admins email I might be able to use the reset user function to reset the admin's password.

![profile](/assets/images/road/profile.png)

On the ResetUser page the username is grey out but I put in a new password and opened Burp. With Intercept on I submitted the request.

![resetuser](/assets/images/road/resetuser.png)

In Burp I can see my account name but no protection mechanisms.

![pwreset](/assets/images/road/pwreset.png)

I changed the username to the admin account and forward the request.

![adminpwreset](/assets/images/road/adminpwreset.png)

I now have access to the admin account!

![admindashboard](/assets/images/road/admindashboard.png)

### Initial Access

Now I have access to the admin account, I should be able to upload a file. The site is using PHP so I tried uploading a php reverse shell. I copied a PHP reverse shell to my directory and edited the IP and port.

```highlight
└──╼ $cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php .
┌─[daz@parrotos]─[~/Documents/TryHackMe/Road]
└──╼ $mv php-reverse-shell.php shell.php
```

I then uploaded the file and started a listener using the command '```nc -nvlp 4444```'.

![upload](/assets/images/road/upload.gif)

The profile picture (top right) hasn't changed or error'd, so I inspect the element to show the src reference.

![profilesource](/assets/images/road/profilesource.png)

My upload is not in the assets folder.

![assets](/assets/images/road/assets.png)

However, looking at the source code for the profile page 'http://10.10.149.149/v2/profile.php' is a comment with a path for profile images. 

![sourcecode](/assets/images/road/sourcecode.png)

>>> The first time I scanned the source code I missed the comment, using curl is a quick and crude way of pulling all the comments off a web page which can be useful with a large web page.

```highlight
└──╼ $curl -s http://10.10.149.149/v2/profile.php | grep '<!--'
    <!--<link rel="stylesheet" href="../assets/css/bootstrap.min.css" crossorigin="anonymous">-->
  <!-- <script src="/assets/js/dataTable.min.js"></script> -->
                    <!-- <div class="alert alert-danger">Take action</div> -->
          <!-- </ul> -->
<!-- /v2/profileimages/ -->
<!-- Include Required Prerequisites -->
<!-- Include Date Range Picker -->
```

Going to the path, I can list the images however I know I named my file shell.php so I navigate to 'http://10.10.149.149/v2/profileimages/shell.php'.

![profileimages](/assets/images/road/profileimages.png)

I have a shell!

```highlight

```

### Priv Esc 1

I got a shell as www-data, I can use this to grab the user.txt flag but I need to now find a way to become the webdeveloper user.

```highlight
$ whoami

I enumerate the box and take a look at the listening ports and find MongoDB is listening on 27017.

Connecting to mongo I found the webdeveloper credentials, Ive redacted them in the output below.

### Priv Esc 2

Once connected as webdeveloper I did '```sudo -l```', there is a binary the user can run that could be vulnerable however LD_PRELOAD is configured which could also provide a path to priv esc. 

```highlight
webdeveloper@sky:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for webdeveloper on sky:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, env_keep+=LD_PRELOAD

User webdeveloper may run the following commands on sky:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/sky_backup_utility
webdeveloper@sky:~$                                                                    
```

Using the [article](https://www.hackingarticles.in/linux-privilege-escalation-using-ld_preload/) at Hacking Articles provides a great step by step on how to exploit this. I created the shell.c file as per the article and run the sudo command to become root!

```highlight
webdeveloper@sky:/tmp$ gcc -fPIC -shared -o shell.so shell.c -nostartfiles
webdeveloper@sky:/tmp$ sudo LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/shell.so /usr/bin/sky_backup_utility
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
# whoami
