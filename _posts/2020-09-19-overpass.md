### Overview

Overpass is an easy room from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) with the description:

> What happens when a group of broke Computer Science students try to make a password manager? 
> Obviously a perfect commercial success!

The room is part of the Overpass series, over the next few weeks I plan to provide a write up for each series machine.

![THMSeries](/assets/images/overpass/series.png)

We have two tasks to complete, finding both the user and root flag. Typical CTF style room. Also a TryHackMe subscription code was hidden in the box, the first person to find and activate got a one month subscription for free. This has long been claimed however we will also find the code as part of the write up.

### Nmap

TryHackMe will assign a dynamic IP as part of the deployment, the IP I will be targeting is '10.10.70.101'. I started by doing an nmap scan to check what ports are open.

```

### Enumeration

Only 2 ports open SSH and HTTP. I will start with HTTP as SSH as a smaller attack surface however the SSH banner does indicate its a Ubuntu machine. Also interestingly the HTTP banner is showing Golang net. Go is a open source programming language by Google. 

First I will take a look at the webpage.

![THMSeries](/assets/images/overpass/homepage.png)

Clicking around its a basic webpage for a secure password manager. On the 'About Us' page I found a list of usernames:

- Ninja - Lead Developer
- Pars - Shibe Enthusiast and Emotional Support Animal Manager
- Szymex - Head Of Security
- Bee - Chief Drinking Water Coordinator
- MuirlandOracle - Cryptography Consultant

These may be helpful later. 

Also a download page is available to download the software.

![Downloads](/assets/images/overpass/downloads.png)

Ive downloaded a copy of the Linux binary, the source code and the build script. Before I look at them I ran a gobuster on the webpages to check for any other directories.

/admin is new. This brings me to a simple login page. 

![admin](/assets/images/overpass/admin.png)

I tried various combinations of basic logins, admin/admin, admin/password etc but nothing worked. So I had a look at the source code for the admin page.

```

/login.js looks interesting.

```highlight
async function postData(url = '', data = {}) {
    // Default options are marked with *
    const response = await fetch(url, {
        method: 'POST', // *GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
        cache: 'no-cache', // *default, no-cache, reload, force-cache, only-if-cached
        credentials: 'same-origin', // include, *same-origin, omit
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
        },
        redirect: 'follow', // manual, *follow, error
        referrerPolicy: 'no-referrer', // no-referrer, *client
        body: encodeFormData(data) // body data type must match "Content-Type" header
    });
    return response; // We don't always want JSON back
}
const encodeFormData = (data) => {
    return Object.keys(data)
        .map(key => encodeURIComponent(key) + '=' + encodeURIComponent(data[key]))
        .join('&');
}
function onLoad() {
    document.querySelector("#loginForm").addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
        //on pressing enter
        event.preventDefault()
        login()
    });
}
async function login() {
    const usernameBox = document.querySelector("#username");
    const passwordBox = document.querySelector("#password");
    const loginStatus = document.querySelector("#loginStatus");
    loginStatus.textContent = ""
    const creds = { username: usernameBox.value, password: passwordBox.value }
    const response = await postData("/api/login", creds)
    const statusOrCookie = await response.text()
    if (statusOrCookie === "Incorrect credentials") {
        loginStatus.textContent = "Incorrect Credentials"
        passwordBox.value=""
    } else {
        Cookies.set("SessionToken",statusOrCookie)
        window.location = "/admin"
    }
}
```

Looking at the login function it appears the script will send a post request to /api/login and wait for a response. If the response equals "Incorrect credentials" the text is displayed to the user and the password field is reset to blank. However if the response does not equal "Incorrect credentials" a cookie is set. I wonder if I can set the cooke to any value and it will allow me to log in?

### Foothold

First I clear the data and cookies from my browser. Then using a cookie editor I add the session token with a random value.

![cookie](/assets/images/overpass/cookie.png)

Now when I refresh the page I'm logged in and find James's SSH key.

![key](/assets/images/overpass/key.png)

The key is encrypted so if I try and use it to log in it wont work unless I provide a password. I can use John to first get the hash and then crack to get the password. I coped the key to a text file called 'key', than ran ssh2john to get the hash. Then used john to crack it. 

```highlight

Ive removed the password from the output but the password was cracked and I can now use that to log in. First I chmod 600 the key file so I can use it to log in.

james@overpass-prod:~$ 
```

Im in! I can now grab the user.txt flag.

```highlight
james@overpass-prod:~$ ls
todo.txt  user.txt
james@overpass-prod:~$ cat user.txt
thm{65c1aaf0005{{REDACTED}}
james@overpass-prod:~$ 
```

### Priv Esc

Now to get root, when I grabbed the user.txt file I noticed a todo.txt file.

```highlight
james@overpass-prod:~$ cat todo.txt 
To Do:
> Update Overpass' Encryption, Muirland has been complaining that it's not strong enough
> Write down my password somewhere on a sticky note so that I don't forget it.
  Wait, we make a password manager. Why don't I just use that?
> Test Overpass for macOS, it builds fine but I'm not sure it actually works
> Ask Paradox how he got the automated build script working and where the builds go.
  They're not updating on the website
james@overpass-prod:~$ 
```

I will also run [linpeas](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite) to see if anything jumps out.

Scrolling through the output I find a cron job running every minute:

```highlight
* * * * * root curl overpass.thm/downloads/src/buildscript.sh | bash
```

I doubt overpass.thm is a legitmate url so I checked the local host file.

```highlight
james@overpass-prod:~$ cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.1.1 overpass-prod
127.0.0.1 overpass.thm
# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
james@overpass-prod:~$ 
```

So as root the cronjob is downloading the build script and piping it to bash. This looks to be our path to root if I can manipulate it. 

```highlight
james@overpass-prod:~$ ls -lah /etc/crontab
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 822 Jun 27 04:18 /etc/crontab
james@overpass-prod:~$ 
james@overpass-prod:~$ ls -la /etc/hosts
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 250 Jun 27 02:39 /etc/hosts
james@overpass-prod:~$ 
```

I don't have permissions to change the cron job however I can change the hosts file and change the IP to point to my machine. I create the /downloads/src folders and a text file called buildscript.sh with the bash one liner found on [pentestmonkey](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet). I started a python webserver on port 80 and a netcat listener on port 8080 and waited for the cron job to run.

```highlight

I have root! Now to grab the flag.

```highlight
root@overpass-prod:~# cat root.txt
cat root.txt
thm{7f336f8c359{{REDACTED}}
root@overpass-prod:~# 
```

### The hidden code

During our enumeration we were able to download a Linux binary and the source code of the password manager however they were not used to root on the machine. Lets take a look at them now. 

```highlight
┌─[daz@parrot]─[~/Documents/TryHackMe/Overpass]
└──╼ $cat buildscript.sh 
GOOS=linux /usr/local/go/bin/go build -o ~/builds/overpassLinux ~/src/overpass.go
GOOS=windows /usr/local/go/bin/go build -o ~/builds/overpassWindows.exe ~/src/overpass.go
GOOS=darwin /usr/local/go/bin/go build -o ~/builds/overpassMacOS ~/src/overpass.go
GOOS=freebsd /usr/local/go/bin/go build -o ~/builds/overpassFreeBSD ~/src/overpass.go
GOOS=openbsd /usr/local/go/bin/go build -o ~/builds/overpassOpenBSD ~/src/overpass.go
echo "$(date -R) Builds completed" >> /root/buildStatus
```

The build script.sh is a very simple bash script to build the binaries. So I next ran the Linux binary to see what the binary did.

```highlight

```

When you run the binary you get 5 options but also an interesting message "open /home/daz/.overpass: no such file or directory" First I ran option 4 to see if any default values were included, but nothing was returned. So I then selected option 2, to set a password. Now when I ran the binary the message had gone and selecting option 4 displayed the values I had set.

Next I decided to look at the source code to see what the program was doing. Not being that familiar with Go I scanned through to see what jumped out. 

```highlight
//Encrypt the credentials and write them to a file.                                 
func saveCredsToFile(filepath string, passlist []passListEntry) string {            
        file, err := os.OpenFile(filepath, os.O_TRUNC|os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY, 0644)
        if err != nil {                                                             
                fmt.Println(err.Error())                                            
                return err.Error()                                                  
        }                                                                           
        defer file.Close()                                                          
        stringToWrite := rot47(credsToJSON(passlist))                               
        if _, err := file.WriteString(stringToWrite); err != nil {                  
                fmt.Println(err.Error())                                            
                return err.Error()                                                  
        }                                                                           
        return "Success"                                                            
}                                                                                   
```

I found the encrypt function, what jumped out was its using rot47 to encrypt the sting and is indeed saving it to a local file. When I ran linpeas I noticed a tryhackme account on the system, I wonder if that has a .overpass file in the home directory and if so can we decode it?
