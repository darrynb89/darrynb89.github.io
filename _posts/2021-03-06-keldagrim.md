### Overview

[Keldagrim](https://tryhackme.com/room/keldagrim) is a medium level CTF room on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) created by [Optional](https://twitter.com/optionalctf).

> Can you overcome the forge and steal all of the gold!

### Nmap

I deployed the machine and was given the target IP 10.10.252.142 I started a nmap scan to check the available ports.

2 Ports open:

- 80 - HTTP - Werkzeug httpd 1.0.1

I also ran a full port scan but no additional ports were found.

### Enumeration

I opened up my browser and started to have a look at the web page.

![webpage](/assets/images/keldagrim/webpage.png)

Nothing really stood out however when I looked at the source code I could see a disabled link to /admin

```highlight
    <li class="nav-item dropdown">
        <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" id="navbarDropdown" role="button" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">
          Buy Gold
        </a>
        <div class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="navbarDropdown">
            <a class="dropdown-item" href="/wow">World of Warcraft</a>
            <a class="dropdown-item" href="/OSRunescape">Old School Runescape</a>
            <a class="dropdown-item" href="/runescape">Runescape3</a>
          <div class="dropdown-divider"></div>
          <a class="dropdown-item " href="/admin">Admin</a>
        </div>
      </li>
</ul>
```

However the page looks pretty much the same. So I looked at cookies and found a session cooke with a base64 value.

![guest](/assets/images/keldagrim/guest.png)

There are lots of ways to change the base64 to plaintext but I really like [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) at the moment. Using CyberChef I was able to see the value was 'guest'.

![cyberchef](/assets/images/keldagrim/cyberchef.png)

I used CyberChef again to encode 'admin' in to base64.

![adminhash](/assets/images/keldagrim/adminhash.png)

Simply changing the session cookie value to the base64 output and refreshing the page now allowed me to see - 'Current user - $2,165' and be provided with a sales cookie.

![sales](/assets/images/keldagrim/sales.png)

This was also base64 encoded, CyberChef has a great feature called 'Magic', if you are unsure how something is encoded use magic to suggest and test various operations.

![saleshash](/assets/images/keldagrim/saleshash.png)

This next bit took some time, I was able to base64 a string and input it in to the sales cookie and it would be displayed on the webpage, however I was unsure how I would be able to use this to get a foothold on the box. After some googling, I tried a technique called Server Side Template Injection (SSTI). This was not something I had tried to exploit before so I did some research on the technique to try and understand it and used [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection) to see if I was on the right track. 

I found a payload \{\{7\*\'7'\}\} and if I had SSTI that should result in 7777777. I encoded the payload in base64 and updated the sales cookie with the output. 

![sstipayload](/assets/images/keldagrim/sstipayload.png)

Refreshed the page and confirmed I had SSTI in the sales cookie!

### Initial Access

On the same [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection) page was an example for remote code execution. I took the example for exploiting an SSTI by calling Popen without guessing the offset, changed the IP and port values and encoded again with base64.

I opened a nc listener and updated the sales cookie with the base64 output and got a shell!

```highlight
└──╼ $nc -nvlp 4444

```

### Priv Esc

Now to get root i checked 'sudo -l'.

```highlight
$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for jed on keldagrim:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, env_keep+=LD_PRELOAD

User jed may run the following commands on keldagrim:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/ps
```

I had a look at [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) for '/bin/ps' but as expected I didn't find anything, I also noticed 'env_keep+=LD_PRELOAD'. There is a great course by [Heath Adams](https://twitter.com/thecybermentor) on [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-privilege-escalation-for-beginners) for Linux privesc techinques and this is covered as part of the course. There is also a great [article](https://touhidshaikh.com/blog/2018/04/12/sudo-ld_preload-linux-privilege-escalation/) which covers it.

I used the steps in the article to create a file called evil.c, compiled with GCC. Ran the sudo command with LD_PRELOAD and got root!

```highlight
jed@keldagrim:/dev/shm$ sudo LD_PRELOAD=/dev/shm/evil.so ps
root@keldagrim:/dev/shm# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
root@keldagrim:/dev/shm# 
```

Thanks for reading!
