## Whoami?

My name is Darryn Brownfield, I have been working in the networking and security industry since 2010. I started on a first line help desk and worked my way to become a network engineer, solutuions architect and now working as a penetration tester in the UK. I typically focus on CTF and bug bounty write ups.
