## Whoami?

My name is Darryn Brownfield and I'm currently working as a network engineer in the UK. I have been working in the networking and IT field now for over 11 years and have a passion for cybersecurity. I achieved OSCP in 2020 and currently working on other certifications, I typically focus on CTF write ups but hoping to start bug bounties soon and will also post on the experience.
